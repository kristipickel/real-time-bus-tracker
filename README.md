# MBTA Real Time Bus Tracker

## Description
API data used to track route one of the MBTA busses in real time. 

## Instruction
Fork this respository to your own, and then drag the html file into your browser. Watch as the markers begin to move on the map.

## Improvements
Updates that I would like to come back and do are changing the markers to be actual icons.
